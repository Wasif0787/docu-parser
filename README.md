- The uploaded images are sent to the backend.

Step 2: Text Extraction

- The backend uses Google Vision API to extract raw text from the uploaded images.

Step 3: Data Parsing with Regex

- The extracted text is processed using regex patterns to identify and extract fields like:
  - Name
  - Document Number
  - Expiration Date

Environment Variables
